# JSF-Solutions

This is the public repo for students who wish to contribute solutions and examples to lessons from [Learn JavaScript with Zell](https://learnjavascript.today/).

If you need assistance in regards to this repo, you can contact me: [stephen.e.chiang@gmail.com](mailto:stephen.e.chiang@gmail.com) -or- @Stephen on Zell's Slack channel.

## Rules and procedure for contributing

All students are welcome to contribute solutions or request examples. This is a great way to get comfortable with markdown, Git and also learning how to write good examples, explanations, and quality comments.

To make a contribution, please make a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

**_Please do NOT merge them yourself_**.

The following information should be included as a minimum.

1. Lesson and question the solution / example addresses.
2. Explanation (spell and grammar checked) of your code.
3. Line comments where needed.
4. Screenshots if appropriate.

**_I'm currently moving from Denmark to Norway so merges will be delayed_**
